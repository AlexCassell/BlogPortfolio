Learning GraphQL as I build this website.  So far I do not understand much but I have been able to add postType as a MarkdownRemark (I probably worded that incorrectly), and now only certain types of posts are shown in the front page blog area.  Now I am trying to get 'keywords' to work, going about it the same way (I thought) but I keep getting errors when I try to add this new variable.
